prompt = """
Please use the available Slidev subcommands to help the user with presentation tasks based on their natural language request.

Analyze the user request and determine the most appropriate subcommand:

- For initializing a new project: use `/init`
- For generating content from a topic/outline: use `/generate`
- For adding a new slide: use `/add`
- For editing existing slides or styles: use `/edit`
- For exporting the presentation (PDF/PNG): use `/export`
- For starting the development server: use `/run`

Be intelligent about interpreting the user's intent. For example:
- "Create a new deck about AI" -> `/generate`
- "Start the server" -> `/run`
- "Add a slide about features" -> `/add`
- "Save as PDF" -> `/export`

User request: {{args}}
